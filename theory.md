### INTRODUCTION<br>
<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The Francis turbine is a reaction turbine, in which the fluid changes pressure as it moves through the turbine, giving up its energy. The turbine is located between the high pressure water source and the low pressure water exit. The inlet of turbine is in spiral shape. The guide vanes direct the water tangentially to the turbine wheel which is known as a runner. This radial flow of water acts on the runner's vanes, causing the runner to spin. The guide vanes may be adjustable to allow efficient turbine operation for a range of water flow conditions. At the point of exit, the water leaves with no swirl and very little kinetic or potential energy. The shape of the turbine's exit tube helps to decelerate the flow of water and recover the pressure.</p>

<h4 style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><strong>Main parts</strong>:</h4>

  <p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">1. <strong>Spiral casing</strong>: The runner is completely enclosed in an air-tight spiral casing. The casing and runner are always full of water. The water from the penstocks enters the casing in which area of cross-section of the casing goes on decreasing gradually. Since the casing is spiral shape, the water enters the runner at constant velocity throughout the circumference of the runner.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">2. <strong>Guide vanes</strong>: The guide vanes allow the water to strike the vanes fixed on the runner without any shake at the inlet. Also by a suitable arrangement, the width between two adjacent vanes of a guide’s mechanism can be adjusted, so that the amount of water striking the runner can be varied.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">3. <strong>Runner/Impeller</strong>: It is a circular wheel on which a series of radial curved vanes are fixed and the surface of the vanes is made very smooth. The radial curved vanes are so shaped that the water enters and leaves the runner without shock. The runners are made of cast steel, cast iron or stainless steel. The runner is connected to the shaft.</p>

  <p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">4. <strong>Draft tube</strong>: Draft tube is or pipe of gradually increasing area which is used for discharging the water from the turbine to the tail race. The pressure at the exit of the runner is generally less than atmosphere pressure. Hence the water is discharged to tail race through the draft tube.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Let,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><img src="./images/equations/r1.png" title="R_1" />= Radius of wheel at inlet of the vane</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><img src="./images/equations/r2.png" title="R_2" />= Radius of wheel at outlet of the vane</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><img src="./images/equations/omega.png" title="\omega" />= Angular speed of the wheel</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Tangential speed of the vane at inlet = <img src="./images/equations/ur1.png" title="u_1 = \omeaga R_1" /></p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Tangential speed of the vane at outlet = <img src="./images/equations/ur2.png" title="u_2 = \omeaga R_2" /></p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The velocity triangles at inlet and outlet are drawn as shown in figure. <img src="./images/equations/alpha.png" title="\alpha" /> and <img src="./images/equations/beta.png" title="\beta" /> are the angles between the absolute velocities of jet and vane at inlet and outlet respectively. <img src="./images/equations/theta.png" title="\theta" /> and <img src="./images/equations/fi.png" title="\psi" /> are vane angles at inlet and outlet respectively.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">where, a is the area of jet or flow and <img src="./images/equations/v1.png" title="V_1" /> is the velocity of flow at inlet.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The momentum of water striking a series of vanes per second at inlet is given by the product of mass of water striking per second and the component of velocity of flow at inlet = <img src="./images/equations/rav.png" title="\rho a V_1 \times V_{w1}" />, where <img src="./images/equations/vw.png" title="V_{w1}" /> is the velocity component of flow at inlet along tangential direction. Similarly momentum of water striking a series of vanes per second at outlet is given by <img src="./images/equations/rav.png" title="\rho a V_1 \times V_{w1}" />, where <img src="./images/equations/nvw.png" title="-V_{w1}" /> is the velocity component of flow at inlet along tangential direction and the -ve sign is because the velocity component is acting in the opposite direction. Now angular momentum per second at inlet is given by the product of momentum of water at inlet and its radial distance = <img src="./images/equations/rvr.png" title="\rho a V_1 \times V_{w1}\times R_1" /> and angular momentum per second at inlet =−<img src="./images/equations/rvr2.png" title="\rho a V_1 \times V_{w2}\times R_2" /></p>

<h4 style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Cavitation: </h4>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Cavitation is an effect mainly on the reaction turbine when water pressure drops below the critical pressure (generally vapour pressure) at constant temperature and vapour cavities are formed and grow based on the dynamic pressure reduction. Cavitation in hydraulic machines negatively affects their performance and may cause severe damages. Cavitation commonly occurs in hydraulic turbines, around runner exit and in the draft tube.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Cavitation is a phenomenon occurs when the static pressure of the liquid falls below its vapour pressure, the liquid boils and large number of small bubbles of vapours are formed. These bubbles mainly formed due to low pressure and carried by the stream to higher pressure zones where the vapours condense and the bubbles suddenly collapse, as the vapours are condensed to liquid again. This results in the formation of a cavity and the surrounding liquid rushes to fill it from all direction which collide at the centre of cavity giving rise to a very high local pressure whose magnitude may be as high as 7000 atm. Formation of cavity and high pressure are repeated many thousand times a second. This causes pitting on the metallic surface of runner blades or draft tube. The material then fails by fatigue, added by corrosion.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">There are two ways to reduce the cavitation damage. One involves optimizing the hydraulic design of equipment and the other involves developing coatings for the substrates of wetted parts, which can prolong the overhaul interval of hydraulic components.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Cavitation in general is slow process but the effect of cavitation is severe. Damaged caused by cavitation, if summarized are: erosion of material from turbine parts, distortion of blade angle, loss of efficiency due to erosion/distortion (Santa JF et al, 2009) . Prof. D Thoma Suggested a dimensionless number called as Thoma's Cavitation factor σ (sigma), which can be used for determining the region where cavitation takes place in reaction turbines</p>

<center><img src="./images/equations/sigma.png" title="\sigma = \frac{H_a - H_v - H_s}{H}---(1)" /></center>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">Where,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><img src="./images/equations/ha.png" title="H_a" /> is the atmospheric pressure head in m of water</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><img src="./images/equations/hs.png" title="H_s" /> is the suction pressure at outlet of reaction turbine in m of water or height of turbine runner above the tail water surface,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><img src="./images/equations/hv.png" title="H_v" /> is vapour pressure head,</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify"><img src="./images/equations/h1.png" title="H" /> is the net head on the turbine in m of water</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The value of <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> depends on<img src="./images/equations/ns.png" title="N_s" /> (specific speed) of the turbine and for a turbine of given <img src="./images/equations/ns.png" title="N_s" /> the factor <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> can be reduced up-to a certain value up to which its efficiency, <img src="./images/equations/no.png" title="\eta_o" /> remains constant. A further decrease in value of <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> can be reduced up-to a certain value up to which its efficiency, <img src="./images/equations/no.png" title="\eta_o" /> remains constant. A further decrease in value of <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> results in a sharp fall in <img src="./images/equations/no.png" title="\eta_o" />. The value of <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> at this turning point is called critical cavitation factor <img src="./images/equations/sigmac.png" title="\sigma_c" />. The value of <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> for different turbines may be determined with the help of following empirical relationships:</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">For Francis Turbine:</p>
<center><img src="./images/equations/sigmac2.png" title="\sigma^c = 0.625 \times \frac{N_s}{380.78}^2 ----(2)" /></center>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify">The values of <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> from equation (1) is compared with the value of <img src="./images/equations/sigmac.png" title="\sigma_c" /> from equation (2) and if value of <img src="./images/equations/esigma.png" title="\sigma" /> is greater than <img src="./images/equations/sigmac.png" title="\sigma_c" />, cavitation will not occur in that turbine.</p>
